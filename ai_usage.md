AI Usage Documentation:

This project used ChatGPT for assistance with:

- Drafting command templates for Salmon, tximport, and DESeq2.
- Debugging installation issues in Google Colab (SRA Toolkit, Salmon, rpy2).
- Writing summaries, explanations, and report sections.
- Clarifying next steps and workflow organization.

All AI-generated code and text were reviewed, edited, and executed by me.  
No AI was used to generate results; all analyses were run manually in Colab.
